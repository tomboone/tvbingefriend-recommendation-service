"""
Future extensions for collaborative filtering and hybrid recommendations.

These modules are stubbed and will be implemented when user rating data
becomes available. The system is architected to support:

- Collaborative filtering (user-user and item-item)
- Matrix factorization
- Hybrid recommendations combining content-based and collaborative approaches

Current implementation focuses on content-based recommendations using
show metadata, cast/crew, and NLP analysis of summaries.
